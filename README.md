# 🇮🇹 Milan vs. 🇫🇷 Paris: Air Quality Comparative Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
As a Master's student in **Stochastics and Data Science** at the **University of Turin**, I conducted this data analysis to compare air quality trends between **Milan** and **Paris**. 

Living in Northern Italy, air quality is a major environmental and public health concern. The goal of this project was to apply **statistical modeling** and **time-series analysis** to historical **PM2.5** data to uncover the hidden patterns behind the smog.

## 📊 Key Findings & Data Insights
The analysis of the datasets revealed several critical distinctions between the two cities:

1. **Extreme Seasonality in Milan:** The **Time Series Analysis** clearly shows that Milan experiences significant spikes in PM2.5 levels during the **winter months (November to February)**. These levels are often double those of Paris during the same period, likely due to the geographical "Po Valley" effect which traps pollutants.

2. **Statistical Volatility:** The **Box Plot** analysis indicates that Milan not only has a higher median pollution level but also a much wider interquartile range (IQR) and more frequent extreme outliers. This suggests that "unhealthy" air days are more common and severe in Milan than in Paris.

3. **Distribution Patterns:** The **Frequency Histogram** shows a distinct right-skewed distribution for Milan. While Paris maintains a more stable and "lean" distribution toward lower PM2.5 values, Milan has a significant "long tail," representing frequent exposure to high-intensity pollution events.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
- **Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas (Time-series resampling, cleaning)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib & Seaborn (for advanced statistical plotting)
